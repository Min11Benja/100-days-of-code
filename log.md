I did this all on paper and uploaded the pictures to IMG I leave the links below. I have to concentrate on what is esential to the MISSION (Reach mastery and share what Ive done) I 


I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

coding at least 1 Hour a day on projects
Keep learining new things (How to duplicate and coment out sections with quick comands, on ATOM CMD + SHIFT + 7 / CMD + SHIFT + D)

**Thoughts:** 
I wasted alot of time trying to copy the layout of a landing page i found. I used Inspect to try and copy the code and style, this was not sucessfull and took half of my time. I hurried up doing the rest before time was out. 
So stop trying to make it perfect

**Thoughts:** 
I went back to codepen to make the top section of the landing page, I thought modularizing the landing pages sections would be best, now I need to pass this onto the webpage template I had before. Hopefully it wont break.

**Thoughts:** 
CodePen is nice to play and tweak around, but I guess I should start getting the hang of using Atom and folders and stuff for more ambitious projects. So I guess tomorrow i will migrate the stuff ive done in codepen into the min11benja live website and then work in Atom from now on.
